**Registration Form**

This is an Angular project that implements a registration form using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. The form collects user information including name, age, email, and selected course, 
while ensuring proper validation of the input fields.

**Registration Fields**: The form includes the following fields:
  - Name
  - Age
  - Email
  - Course Selection
  - 
  - **Input Validation**: The project implements the following validation rules:
  - The **name** must be greater than 3 characters.
  - The **email** must include an "@" symbol.
  - The **age** must not be greater than 30.
  - All fields are required; if any field is left empty, an error message will be displayed.

- **Error Handling**: Upon submission, if any validation fails, an error message is shown to guide the user in correcting their input.

## Technologies Used
- **Angular**: Framework for building the front-end application.
